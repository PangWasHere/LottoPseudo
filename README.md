# LottoPseudo
Lotto Pseudo, as the name implies, is a fake lotto game which simulates a guessing game. This means you don't really pay real money and you don't win real money. (But hopefully you'll have fun!) The logo is inspired from the logo of Lotto NZ.

As of version 1, there are two guessing games available:

__Guess between 0 - 9__ for $2 and __Guess between 0 - 50__ for $5

The application also monitors the balance of the player. Initially, the player has $10 to play. When the player attempts to play a game with insufficient funds, a pop up will show to allow the player to top up.

Here are the snapshots of the application:
